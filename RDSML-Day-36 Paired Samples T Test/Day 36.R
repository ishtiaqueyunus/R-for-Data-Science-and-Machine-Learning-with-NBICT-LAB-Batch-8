# Result interpretation and reporting
# A paired-samples t-test was used to determine whether there was a
# statistically significant mean difference between the distance ran
# when participants imbibed a carbohydrate-protein drink compared to
# a carbohydrate-only drink. No outliers were detected. The assumption
# of normality was not violated, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test
# (p = 0.780). Participants ran further when imbibing the carbohydrate-
# protein drink (Mean = 11.302 KM, SD = 0.713 KM) as opposed to the
# carbohydrate only drink (Mean = 11.167 KM, SD = 0.726 KM), a
# statistically significant mean increase of 0.136 KM,
# 95% CI [0.091, 0.181]
